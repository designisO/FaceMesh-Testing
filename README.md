In this project I wanted to work with CVzone and Mediapipe with focus of Facial Mesh. The goal is to do detection of a face using machine learning. CVzone uses OpenCV and MediaPipe at the core which allows ML to be used on Android, iOS and desktop.

### Dependencies

* Python 3.10
* CVzone (https://github.com/cvzone/cvzone)
* MediaPipe (https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/face_mesh)
